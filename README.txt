What is w16?

w16 is an open-source tool that uses
the Nmap API to scan and identify all 
devices connected to a Wi-Fi network. 

It automatically connects to the same
network you are using.

The tool can identify the IP address,
MAC address, and model or manufacturer
of each device. 

All information is stored in a dedicated 
logs folder, accompanied by the date 
for better organization.

To ensure optimal performance, it is
recommended to run the tool with 
administrator privileges. 

The time required for scanning may vary
 depending on the strength of your internet
 connection and the number of devices on 
the network.

If you use this tool, please remember to 
credit the creator.
